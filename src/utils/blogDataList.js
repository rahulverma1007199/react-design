Historically, African-American people’s hair has been perceived as “ugly, unruly and unprofessional” by powerful racial groups in Western societies, for not meeting Eurocentric standards of beauty. Non-straight hair has been seen and treated “differently” in other societies, too. Even in India, this perception of it being “different” persists, albeit less evidently. Here’s how.",

        desc:"There are few creatures in history to have fascinated humans as much as the Loch Ness monster. Affectionately called Nessie, the monster is a creature in Scottish folklore, believed to live in the stygian depths of the Loch (lake in Scottish) Ness, in the Scottish Highlands.Over the years, Nessie has drawn thousands of monster hunters to Scottish shores, has had multiple claimed sightings, and become an enduring symbol in popular culture. Yet definitive proof of Nessie’s existence has been elusive, with many famous ‘findings’ ultimately turning out to be hoaxes. This weekend, Loch Ness Exploration, a volunteer research group, is leading the latest search, billed as the largest conducted from the surface of the lake since 1972. With the help of heat-detecting drones and a hydrophone, which detects acoustic signals under water, the group hopes to detect “unusual” movements in the lake.",
